Parking Violations in NYC
================================



## Data

For this assignment, we are going to investigate data on parking violations in NYC. 

#### Parking violations in 2020/21

NYC Open Data has data on all [parking violations issued in NYC](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Parking-Violations-Issued-Fiscal-Year-2021/pvqr-7yc4) since 2014. The updated dataset provided for 2021 currently includes about 10 million observations. To make the assignment manageable, I have reduced it to a subset of tickets issued in from Jan 2020 to Jan 2021 and by Manhattan precincts only, yielding about 2.2M tickets.

Two support files are also included in the `parking` sub folder:

  - the **descriptions of all variables**
  - the **dictionary of violation codes**
  
#### Police Precincts

A second data source is the [shape files of police precincts in NYC](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/planning/data-maps/open-data/districts-download-metadata.page). 

## Exercise

##### 1. Data exploration

Before focusing on the spatial part of the data, let's explore the basic patterns in the data. 


```r
df <- read.csv('./data/parking/parkingNYC_Jan2020-Jan2021.csv')
```



```r
library(tibble)
```

##### a) Violation Code and Fine Amounts

Add the violation code descriptions and fine amounts to the data file. Provide a visual overview of the top 10 most common types of violations (feel free to group them into categories if reasonable). Compare how this ranking differs if we focus on the total amount of revenue generated.

There are some overlaps between the frequency of top traffic violations, and their associated fine amounts. 

##### b) Average amount of fine by vehicle

Compare the average amount of fine by vehicle color, vehicle year, and [vehicle plate type](https://dmv.ny.gov/registration/registration-class-codes) [Hint: it is sufficient to restrict your attention to commercial (`COM`) and passenger (`PAS`) vehicles]? Briefly describe your findings.

No firm conclusions can be drawn about variation in average fine amounts, according to `Vehicle.Color`, because the data is very unclean. However, it is noteworthy that for `High Fine Amt`, there are many more color types. A preliminary hypothesis that cars with novel colors might be more likely to have committed violations with higher fine amounts. A visual inspection of the tables also show the prevalence of more colors that might not be represented for vehicles that have caused `Medium Fine Amt` and `Low Fine Amt` violations.

The earlier a car is registered, the more likely that the mean fine amount incurred is a smaller value. The later a car is registered, the more likely that the mean fine amount incurred is a higher value.

Commercial vehicles (M=91.6) seem to incur, on average, higher fines than passenger vehicles (M=89.7). An exploratory one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run to compare the mean fine values of these two groups, and indeed there was a significantly significant difference in fine values (p<.01) between the two groups.

##### c) Effect of COVID

Let's see if we can observe the effect of COVID restrictions on parking violations. Present a visualization that shows how parking violations changed after the New York statewide stay-at-home order on March 14, 2020. Make sure the visualization clearly highlights the main pattern (the COVID effect).

The three maps show that the bulk of traffic violations do happen in the midtown or downtown areas. However, the areas with the largest fines, associated with traffic violations, are not necessarily downtown. The total fine amounts map shows that the Upper East Side area has very high total fine amounts. The average fine maps shows that the region slightly below the Supper East Side, Midtown East, has high average fine amounts. The total and average fines map also show that the more residential areas (i.e., away from downtown, and more toward the upper end of the island) have higher fine amounts that the midtown or downtown areas. 

##### b) Types of violations

Group the almost 100 types of ticket violations into a smaller set of 4-6 subgroups (where `other` should be the remainder of violations not included in other groups you defined). [Hint: No need to spend more than 5 minutes thinking about what the right grouping is.]. Provide choropleth maps for each of these subgroups to show where different types of violations are more or less common.

Somewhat unsurprisingly, the number of in-motion related offences are highest in the areas at the tips of Mantattan, Washington Heights and the financial district, where one might expect the highest amount of traffic to and fro the island. The number of parking-related offences seems concentrated in the Upper East side. Standing-Related Offences and miscellaneous seem concentrated around the midtown area.

#### 3. Focus on the Upper East

[Precinct 19](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/nypd/bureaus/patrol/precincts/19th-precinct.page) identifies the Upper East Side. The data currently does not provide latitude and longitude of the violation locations (and I am not sure what these `street_code` variables are for).

##### a) Ignoring fire hydrants

Restrict your data to parking violations related to fire hydrants (`Violation Code = 40`). Using the variables `Street Name` and `House Number` as well as the knowledge that these addresses are in the Upper East Side of Manhattan, geocode at least 500 addresses. Include a data table of these addresses and the latitude and longitude of these addresses in the output. 


```r
df_fire_hydrants = subset(df_violations, Violation.Code==40)

df_fire_hydrants_uppereast = subset(df_fire_hydrants, Violation.Precinct==19)
```


```r
df_fire_hydrants_uppereast$address = paste(df_fire_hydrants_uppereast$House.Number, df_fire_hydrants_uppereast$Street.Name, "New York City Manhattan Upper East Side", sep = " ")

df_fire_hydrants_uppereast$address[1:5] 
```

```
## [1] "N E 88th St New York City Manhattan Upper East Side"      
## [2] "137 E 76th St New York City Manhattan Upper East Side"

##### c) Luxury cars and repeat offenders

Using the vehicle `Plate ID`, identify repeat offenders (in the full dataset). Create another variable called `luxury_car` in which you identify luxury car brands using the `Vehicle Make` variable.

Start with the previous map. Distinguish the points by whether the car is a repeat offender and/or luxury car. Add a legend informing the user about the color scheme. Also make sure that the added information about the car type and repeat offender status is now contained in the popup information. Show this map.

Note: The data here seems a bit unclean, with some observations categorized as falling within the Upper East Side, when they do not. 

##### d) Cluster

Add marker clustering, so that zooming in will reveal the individual locations but the zoomed out map only shows the clusters. Show the map with clusters.


```r
mclust <- leaflet(df_fire_hydrants_uppereast_geocoded) %>%
  addTiles() %>%    # Add OpenStreetMap map tiles
   addCircleMarkers(color = color_trouble, 
                       popup = content2,
                       clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()) 
```

```
## Assuming "lon" and "lat" are longitude and latitude, respectively
```

```r
mclust
```
